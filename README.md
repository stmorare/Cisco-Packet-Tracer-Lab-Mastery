# Cisco Packet Tracer Lab Mastery

## ***Build and Secure Advanced Topologies***

## Instructor:
Dan Mill

## Course Description:
***This course takes learners through a complete networking journey using Cisco Packet Tracer. It begins with installation and environment setup before moving into building fully functional redundant networks. Concepts such as VLANs, HSRP, spanning tree, and device-level redundancy form the foundation for understanding high availability. The path then advances to creating datacenter networks, exploring spine-leaf architecture, VLAN databases, internal gateway redundancy, NAT, DNS, tunnels, and web servers. Following this, you’ll configure complete company networks with OSPF routing, DHCP relay, syslog, NTP, ACLs, and QoS. Security is emphasized in the DMZ section, where you’ll configure firewalls, edge routers, and access lists while testing LAN, DMZ, and internet connectivity. You’ll also simulate IoT labs with smart homes, offices, and industrial systems, leading into hub-and-spoke WAN topologies and enterprise-grade three-tier switching designs. The journey continues with SOHO networks and culminates in a crash course on Cisco small business devices, covering routers, switches, and wireless. By the end, you’ll have the applied skills to configure, secure, and troubleshoot diverse professional networks.***
